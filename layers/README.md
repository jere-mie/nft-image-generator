# Layers Directory

This is where you need to put your layer folders. The structure of this folder should be as follows:

```
layers/
    layer0/
        0.png
        1.png
        2.png
        ...
    layer1/
        0.png
        1.png
        ...
    ...
```

To see how it should look like, copy all of the folders from `examples/layers` into here.
